## About Me
I primarily use Bitbucket for my projects, so my Github profile consists of simple demos, tutorials, and other practice projects I've completed over the years that I've gradually moved over from Bitbucket. My more extensive projects are kept at Bitbucket in private repos. If youâ€™d like to check out some of my other projects, please get in touch.
